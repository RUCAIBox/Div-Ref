['- The level of financial literacy among senior citizens and young people is relatively low, making them key targets for financial education. This was revealed in the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People released by Nelson and the 2019-2020 Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People by CTV Finance. These reports also show that the younger generation holds great potential for consumption and credit usage has become a crucial way for them to upgrade their lifestyle. Approximately 86.6% of young people are currently using credit products, but nearly half of them have managed to avoid building up any debt. While the younger generation is generally more rational in their spending habits, this differs greatly from the stereotype of them being "excessive spenders" as perceived by society. However, there are some young individuals who succumb to the pressure of excessive consumption and follow trends, resulting in overwhelming financial strain, debt risks, and even causing social issues. In order to address this, financial institutions must take up their social responsibilities and guide young consumers in a positive manner.', 'According to the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People from 2019 to 2020 issued by CTV Finance and the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading; although there is a relatively rational consumption trend among the younger generation, which is drastically different from the label of “excessive squander” put on them by society, some young people indeed are involved in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even resulting in increasing social problems; financial enterprises shall shoulder their social responsibilities and guide young consumers in a positive way; level of financial literacy of senior citizens and young people is relatively low, and they will still be the key objects of financial education; 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt buildup.', 'The level of financial literacy among senior citizens and young people is comparatively low, despite being the primary targets of financial education.

Currently, 86.6% of young people utilize credit products, with almost half of them having no debt accumulation. While there is a prevalent trend of rational consumption among the younger generation, contradicting society\'s perception of them as "excessively wasteful," some young individuals do engage in excessive spending and consumption, driven by social trends. As a result, they face heightened financial strain and debt risks, ultimately leading to social problems.
